# Multisensory Book

This is an iot device that can be controlled using Alexa. Routines can be set up using the Alexa app so that at the designated
time the book will open up and use a variety of modalities to get the users' attention. The code used to make the sound work is 
from [SFX-I2S-web-trigger](https://github.com/bbx10/SFX-I2S-web-trigger) whilst the code used for being able to connect to
Alexa is from [arduino-esp8266-alexa-wemo-switch](https://github.com/kakopappa/arduino-esp8266-alexa-wemo-switch).
